        <p>
            I grew up loving computers and video games, and fondly remember the first time I connected to the internet and the emotions that
          came with it. But my journey from techy-child to now isn't straightforward. My work background is diverse, with experience in
          retail, outdoor leadership and environmental conservation/education, film production, dog-walking, and most recently, recieving
          my clinical doctorate and working as a licensed physical therapist. Each experience has provided me with rich life experiences
          and gains in self-knowledge, and have aided in guiding me to this career that most matches my skills, passions, and interests;
          guiding me back to my childhood delight in playing with computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I pride myself in my innate ability to communicate and develop connections with people of all ages and backgrounds.
          My natural creativity combined with my analytical skills developed through my experience as a physical therapist has proved useful 
          in programming and learning new programming languages. As a web developer I hope to make meaningful content that has the ability to
          positively impact peopleâ€™s lives and their communities.
